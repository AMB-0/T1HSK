**Description**:

The code included in the "Task.py" python script, help us to test that the **amortized complexity** of moving (n-1) times from one node to the next one by using the **inorder** method in a binary tree is 2(x-1)

The program generates random binary trees and then, transverse it by using the inorder method. Finally, the program returns a table with the number of steps used to transverse the tree in addition with the number of nodes included in the random tree generated. 

An example of the output of the program is the following:

|Tree Id |Number of Nodes| Total Steps
|--------|---------------|-------------
|1 |83 |164
|2 |94 |186
|3 |69 |136
|4 |99 |196
|5 |53 |104
|6 |63 |124
|7 |72 |142
|8 |61 |120
|9 |55 |108
|10| 90| 178
|11| 81| 160
|12| 74| 146
|13| 92| 182
|14| 85| 168
|15| 75| 148
|16| 66| 130
|17| 95| 188
|18| 64| 126
|19| 71| 140
|20| 95| 188
|21| 52| 102
|22| 77| 152
|23| 53| 104
|24| 84| 166
|25| 80| 158
